# Autonomous-Car - Data Repository

Welcome to the **Autonomous-Car** data repository! This repository contains essential data files that are used for training and testing the machine learning models for an autonomous car project.

## Data Files

The primary dataset in this repository includes the following:

- **driving_log.csv**: This file contains data logs from the driving sessions, including information such as steering angles, throttle, speed, and more. The data is crucial for training machine learning models to understand the driving behavior and environment.

- **IMG**: This folder contains images related to the driving data, such as camera feeds taken during the car's operation. These images are key to training the computer vision models for the autonomous car.

## Usage

To use this data, simply clone the repository and access the `driving_log.csv` and `IMG` folder. This data can be integrated into your machine learning pipeline to help train and test autonomous vehicle systems.

## Setup

To clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlekhyaGudibandla/track.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate through the data and start working with it as per your project needs.
